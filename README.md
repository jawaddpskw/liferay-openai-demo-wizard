# Liferay OpenAI Demo Wizard Project

Using this application you can quickly configure content for Liferay demo purposes. It uses Open AI's API and Node.js

Contributions are welcome! We can use this as a starting point to build purpose-built generative API functionality using Liferay's headless APIs.

Technologies used:

- [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

1. Clone this repository

1. Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd liferay-openai-demo-wizard
```  

1. Install the requirements

```bash
npm install
```

1. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

1. Add your [API key]([https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)) to the newly created `.env` file

1. Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 

## Deployment

Once you have this up and running locally, make sure to fill in the required Environment Details. These might become UI-based configurations, but for now it is required to configure these settings in your environment variables. 

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key goes here>
LIFERAY_PATH=
LIFERAY_ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS=
LIFERAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
LIFERAY_GLOBAL_SITE_ID=
LIFERAY_CATALOG_ID=
```

## Lets build great things!
