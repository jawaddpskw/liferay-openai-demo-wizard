# Liferay OpenAI Content Creation Wizard 

Using this application you can quickly configure content for Liferay demo purposes. It uses Open AI's API, Liferay's APIs, and Next.js

Contributions are welcome! We can use this as a starting point to build purpose-built generative API functionality using Liferay's headless APIs. 

**Thank you Steven Lu** for the inspiration and knowledge that helped make this functional!

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
