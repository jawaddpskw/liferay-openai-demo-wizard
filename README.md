# Liferay OpenAI Content Creation Wizard 

With this application, creating content within Liferay is a breeze!

Consider this scenario: You can create 15 products across 5 categories in just 35 seconds with a single prompt from you. The magic happens through the integration of OpenAI's API for content creation and Liferay's APIs for seamless storage based on your prompts.

Utilizing this OpenAI Wizard doesn't just speed up content creation, which many of us are already doing with AI. It goes the extra mile by seamlessly loading it into the demo instance through our Liferay APIs. Big kudos to Steven Lu, who helped identify the potential to optimize the time spent on setting up commerce products, categories, and SKUs through Liferay's Headless APIs which then led to the original idea for this integration.

- **Taxonomy with Category Structure**
- **Multilingual FAQs**
- **Generation of Images within Documents and Media with a choice of dimensions and quality**
- **Knowledge Base Folders and Articles**
- **Message Board Sections, Threads, and Messages**
- **Multilingual News Articles with Images**

- **Commerce Categories and Products with Images (AI Generation and File Upload)**

As we move forward, expect more options and deeper integrations for content types.
