# Liferay OpenAI Content Creation Wizard 

With this application, creating content for Liferay demo purposes is a breeze!

Consider this scenario: You can create 15 products across 5 categories in just 35 seconds with a single prompt from you. The magic happens through the integration of OpenAI's API for content creation and Liferay's APIs for seamless storage based on your prompts.

Utilizing this OpenAI Wizard doesn't just speed up content creation, which many of us are already doing with AI. It goes the extra mile by seamlessly loading it into the demo instance through our Liferay APIs. Big kudos to **Steven Lu**, who helped identify the potential to optimize the time spent on setting up commerce products, categories, and SKUs which then led to the original idea for this integration.

## The Liferay Content Wizard currently supports generating these asset types: 

- **Accounts**
- **Blogs with Images**
- **Taxonomy with Category Structure**
- **Commerce Categories and Products with Images (CSV and OpenAI)**
- **Custom Liferay Objects Schemas**
- **Multilingual FAQs**
- **Images Only**
- **Multilingual News Articles with Images**
- **Knowledge Base Folders and Articles**
- **Message Board Sections, Threads, and Messages**
- **Organization Structures**
- **Users (CSV and OpenAI)**

As we move forward, expect more options for different content types. A big shoutout to Steven Lu for the inspiration and knowledge that brought this functionality to life! Cheers!
